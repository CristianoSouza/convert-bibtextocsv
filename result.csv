The lack is exacerbated when the network to be protected is a 5G mobile network. 5G networks push multi-tenancy to the edge of the network. Both the 5G user mobility and multi-tenancy are challenges to be addressed by current security solutions. These challenges lead to an insufficient protection of 5G users, tenants and infrastructures. This research proposes a novel autonomic security system, including the design, implementation and empirical validation to demonstrate the efficient protection of the network against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by applying countermeasures decided on and taken by an autonomic system, instead of a human. The self-management architecture provides support for all the different phases involved in a DDoS attack, from the detection of an attack to its final mitigation, through making the appropriate autonomous decisions and enforcing actions. Empirical experiments have been performed to protect a 5G multi-tenant infrastructure against a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flooding attack, as an example of an attack to validate the design and prototype of the proposed architecture. Scalability results show self-protection against DDoS attacks, without human intervention, in around one second for an attack of 256 simultaneous attackers with 100 Mbps bandwidth per attacker. Furthermore, results demonstrate the proposed approach is flow-, user- and tenant-aware, which allows applying different protection strategies within the infrastructure."; "Autonomic protection of multi-tenant 5G mobile networks against UDP flooding DDoS attacks";

This increasing popularity in online banking services and payment systems has created motivation for financial attackers to steal customer`s credentials and money. Banking trojans have been a way of committing attacks on these financial institutions for more than a decade, and they have become one of the primary drivers of botnet traffic. However, the stealthy nature of financial botnets requires new techniques and novel systems for detection and analysis in order to prevent losses and to ultimately take the botnets down. TrickBot, which specifically threatens businesses in the financial sector and their customers, has been behind man-in-the-browser attacks since 2016. Its main goal is to steal online banking information from victims when they visit their banking websites. In this study, we utilize machine learning techniques to detect TrickBot malware infections and to identify TrickBot related traffic flows without having to analyze network packet payloads, the IP addresses, port numbers and protocol information. Since command and control server IPs are updated almost daily, identification of TrickBot related traffic flows without looking at specific IP addresses is significant. We adopt behavior-based classification that uses artifacts created by the malware during the dynamic analysis of TrickBot malware samples. We compare the performance results of four different state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, Random Forest, Sequential Minimal Optimization, Multilayer Perceptron, and Logistic Model to identify TrickBot related flows and detect a TrickBot infection. Then, we optimize the proposed classifier via exploring the best hyperparameter and feature set selection.

Despite the obvious benefits associated to the proactive detection of security threats, these devices, by performing deep packet inspection and inline analysis, may both affect latency-sensitive traffic introducing non-negligible delays, and increase the energy demand at the network element level. Starting from these considerations, we present a selective routing and intrusion detection technique based on dynamic statistical analysis. Our technique separates latency-sensitive traffic from latency-insensitive one and adaptively organizes the intrusion detection activities over multiple nodes. This allows suppressing directly at the network ingress, when possible, all the undesired components of latency-insensitive traffic and distributing on the innermost nodes the security check for latency sensitive flows, prioritizing routing activities over security scanning ones.

However, with NFV comes numerous challenges related mainly to the complexity of deploying and adjusting VNFs in the physical networks, owing to the huge number of nodes and links in today's datacenters, and the inter-dependency among VNFs forming a certain network service. Several contributions have been made in an attempt to answer these challenges, where most of the existing solutions focus on the static placement of VNFs and overlook the dynamic aspect of the problem, which arises mainly due to the ever-changing resource availability in the cloud datacenters and the continuous mobility of the users. Few attempts have been lately made to incorporate the dynamic aspect to the VNF deployment solutions. The main problem of these approaches lies in their reactive readjustment scheme which determines the placement/migration strategy upon the receipt of a new request or the happening of a certain event, thus resulting in high setup latencies. In this paper, we take advantage of machine learning to reduce the complexity of the placement and readjustment processes through designing a cluster-based proactive solution. The solution consists of (1) an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model that considers a tradeoff between the minimization of the latency, Service-Level Objective (SLO) violation cost, hardware utilization, and VNF readjustment cost, (2) an optimized k-medoids clustering approach which proactively partitions the substrate network into a set of disjoint on-demand clusters and (3) data-driven cluster-based placement and readjustment algorithms that capitalize on machine learning to intelligently eliminate some cost functions from the optimization problem to boost its feasibility in large-scale networks.

Any lapse in cyber security can lead to critical disaster across the city. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are considered to be the most predominant and prevalent cyber-attacks. We believe that smart city could consist of numerous applications with varying level of network and security requirements. Therefore, providing an adaptive mechanism against DDoS attacks for all applications in a smart city is a key challenge. Further, considering the wide-scale requirements of a smart city, developing an adaptive and flexible solution is a key requirement. Considering these requirements, this paper presents SEAL (SEcure and AgiLe) – a novel Software Defined Networking (SDN) based adaptive framework for protecting smart city applications against DDoS attacks. The SEAL framework leverages key characteristics of SDN such as the global visibility, centralized control, and programmability to enhance the security and resilience. SEAL is capable of effectively detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks not only on application servers but also on network resources. SEAL is also unique in this regard that it provides application specific DDoS attack security solution instead of static threshold mechanism. Moreover, inherently distributed architecture of the SEAL framework ensures fault tolerance, scalability and reliability of the smart city. The SEAL framework comprises three modules, namely D-Defense, A-Defense and C-Defense. These modules collectively provide a mechanism to detect and mitigate DDoS attack on smart city applications and the network infrastructure. Adaptability in SEAL is achieved through implementing customized version of estimated-weighted moving average (EWMA) filters. Three types of filters, Proactive Filter, Active Filter, and Passive Filter are proposed and implemented to compute the dynamic threshold in real time for various types of applications. Experimental evaluation of the SEAL framework has been conducted to establish the efficacy of the framework and its components in detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks.

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a promising paradigm to change such situation by decoupling network functions from the underlying dedicated hardware and realizing them in the form of software, which are referred to as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Such decoupling introduces many benefits which include reduction of Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operation Expense (OPEX), improved flexibility of service provision, etc. In this paper, we intend to present a comprehensive survey on NFV, which starts from the introduction of NFV motivations. Then, we explain the main concepts of NFV in terms of terminology, standardization and history, and how NFV differs from traditional middle-box based network. After that, the standard NFV architecture is introduced using a bottom up approach, based on which the corresponding use cases and solutions are also illustrated. In addition, due to the decoupling of network functionalities and hardware, people’s attention is gradually shifted to the VNFs. Next, we provide an extensive and in-depth discussion on state-of-the-art VNF algorithms including VNF placement, scheduling, migration, chaining and multicast. Finally, to accelerate the NFV deployment and avoid pitfalls as far as possible, we survey the challenges faced by NFV and the trend for future directions. In particular, the challenges are discussed from bottom up, which include hardware design, VNF deployment, VNF life cycle control, service chaining, performance evaluation, policy enforcement, energy efficiency, reliability and security, and the future directions are discussed around the current trend towards network softwarization."; "A comprehensive survey of Network Function Virtualization";

However, recent research has revealed feasibility of these attacks by investigating a number of native IPv6 networks. The research concluded that an intelligent attacker could easily reduce the target search space by predicting the network host addressing schemes when performing the scanning. This indeed enhances security concerns and undermines the chances of IPv6 being deployed. This paper outlines the IPv6 addressing strategies currently used and proposes a new strategy to mitigate reconnaissance attacks.

Therefore, to extend the network lifetime and minimum utilization of battery, all the steps from node deployment to network architecture (in our case, we are considering clustered network architecture) and from sensing the environment to sharing the sensed data to the BS (i.e. routing) should be designed in a careful way. Decreasing the broadcasting of packets, and lessening the computation at the node level and minimizing the packet overhead play their important role in the conservation of energy that pushes toward better network throughput. In our under-discussed research work, we are in an aim to increase the network throughput by conserving the energy, especially during the routing process. Our work targets the constituent phases of cluster based aware energy routing for maximizing the throughput by decreasing the end-to-end delay, less packet drop ratio and improving network lifetime.

As the communication within the AMI needs to be secure to protect user’s power data, key management becomes a challenge due to its overhead and limited resources on smart meters. While using public-keys eliminate some of the overhead of key management as opposed to symmetric-key management, there are still challenges regarding the management of certificates that store and certify the public-keys. In particular, distribution and storage of certificate revocation list (CRL) is major a challenge due to cost of distribution and storage in AMI networks which is envisioned to utilize wireless mesh networks. Motivated by the need of keeping the CRL distribution and storage cost effective and scalable, in this paper, we present a distributed CRL management scheme by utilizing distributed hash trees (DHTs) that have been heavily employed in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The basic idea is to share the burden of storage of CRLs among all the smart meters by exploiting the convenient wireless communication capability of the smart meters among each other. Using DHTs not only reduces the space requirements for CRLs but also makes the CRL updates more convenient. We implemented DHT-based CRL structure both on ns-3 and testbed using IEEE 802.11s mesh standard as a model for AMI and demonstrated its superior performance with respect to traditional methods of CRL management through extensive simulations."; "Efficient certificate revocation management schemes for IoT-based advanced metering infrastructures in smart cities";

As a result, these organizations are also more vulnerable to information theft through different forms of security breaches caused by hackers and competitors. One way of understanding the vulnerability of an information system is to build and analyze the attack graph of that system. The attack graph of an information system contains all the paths that can be used to penetrate the system in order to breach critical assets. Although existing literature provides an abundance of attack graph generation algorithms, more methods are required to help analyze the attack graphs. In this paper, we study how best to deploy security countermeasures to protect an organization by analyzing the vulnerability of the organization through the use of its attack graph. In particular, we present an approach to find an optimal affordable subset of arcs, called an interdiction plan, on an attack graph that should be protected from attack to minimize the loss due to security breaches. We formulate this problem as a bi-level mixed-integer linear program and develop an exact algorithm to solve it. Experiments show that the algorithm is able to solve relatively large problems. Two heuristic methods, one with and the other without a heuristic to solve the master problem and both limiting the master problem branch-and-bound tree to only one node solve the large problems remarkably well. Experiments also reveal that the quality of an interdiction plan is relatively insensitive with respect to the error in the estimate of the attacker's budget, and that the breach loss drops sharply at the beginning, then levels off before finally dropping sharply again with increases in the security budget."; "Interdicting attack graphs to protect organizations from cyber attacks: A bi-level defender–attacker model";

We aimed to address the accessibility issue by designing and prototyping an Invi-server system, in which the IP and MAC addresses of the protected secret server remain invisible from external scanning and eavesdropping trials and even from compromised internal hosts on the network. This Invi-server system can be used as a way to reduce the attack surface of a protected server while allowing authorized users to send and receive packets via the protected server.

This work contributes to the cyber security research field with a design that can incorporate advanced scheduling algorithms and predictive models in a parallel and distributed way, in order to improve intrusion detection in the current scenario, where increased demand for global and wireless interconnection has weakened approaches based on protection tasks running only on specific perimeter security devices. The aim of this paper is to provide a framework to properly distribute intrusion detection system (IDS) tasks, considering security requirements and variable availability of computing resources. To accomplish this, we propose a novel approach, which promotes the integration of personal and enterprise computing resources with externally supplied cloud services, in order to handle the security requirements. For example, in a business environment, there is a set information resources that need to be specially protected, including data handled and transmitted by small mobile devices. These devices can execute part of the IDS tasks necessary for self-protection, but other tasks could be derived to other more powerful systems. This integration must be achieved in a dynamic way: cloud resources are used only when necessary, minimizing utility computing costs and security problems posed by cloud, but preserving local resources when those are required for business processes or user experience. In addition to satisfying the main objective, the strengths and benefits of the proposed framework can be explored in future research. This framework provides the integration of different security approaches, including well-known and recent advances in intrusion detection as well as supporting techniques that increase the resilience of the system. The proposed framework consists of: (1) a controller component, which among other functions, decides the source and target hosts for each data flow; and (2) a switching mechanism, allowing tasks to redirect data flows as established by the controller scheduler. The proposed approach has been validated through a number of experiments. First, an experimental DIDS is designed by selecting and combining a number of existing IDS solutions. Then, a prototype implementation of the proposed framework, working as a proof of concept, is built.

So it has been applied extensively in many areas requesting temporary communication such as military field, emergency disaster relief and road traffic. While, due to the feature of self-organization and wireless communication channels, ad-hoc network is more vulnerable to various attacks compared to the traditional network. In this paper, we proposed a plug and play device to detect Denial of Service (DoS) and privacy attacks. This device mainly includes capture tool and deep learning detection model. Capture tool is used to grab packets in ad-hoc networks, deep learning detection model is used for detecting attacks. An alarm will be triggered if the detected result is attack. In this way, we can avoid the detected attack to spreading out in larger scale. The proposed method can be used as the second line of dense to issue the early-warning signal. In the experiment, first, we use Deep neural network (DNN) detection model to detect DoS attacks; next, we use DNN, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) detection model to detect XSS and SQL attacks. The results show that these detection models can achieve very high Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1−score. In addition, the time efficiency among the CNN, the LSTM and the DNN is in acceptable range. It proofs that the proposed method can be effectively applied for attack detection. It is important to note that the proposed method can be extended to all other attacks with little modification in ad-hoc networks."; "Anomaly detection in ad-hoc networks based on deep learning model: A plug and play device";

In this perspective, this paper surveys and highlights the most recent work on energy-awareness and security. Also, it summarizes the current state of the art on general techniques to save energy, as well as tools to perform measurements.

Specifically, network resources (e.g. switches or routers) only perform Internet Protocol (IP) packet forwarding in the data plane based on rules dictated by SDN controllers that implement the control plane. Despite the applicability of SDNs to manage network security is a hot topic, managing security associations using SDNs to protect data plane communications is not well covered in the literature. In this sense, the IP Security (IPsec) protocol is the standard to protect IP traffic at network level and it is foreseen a key element in the forthcoming 5G networks or Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN). Traditionally, the IPsec operation is assisted by a key management protocol, such as the Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2), responsible for establishing IPsec Security Associations (IPsec SAs). Yet, manual configuration of IKEv2 is still required, which does not scale when the number of IPsec entities is high. In this paper we propose a solution to manage IPsec SAs using SDNs avoiding manual configuration in the network resources and enabling a reduced involvement of network administrators. We present two different cases, IKE case and IKE-less case, balancing between the participation of the SDN controller in the IPsec management and the complexity of the network resource. We provide a comprehensive explanation and deep analysis of the solution, which is undergoing standardization at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), describing the interfaces, the operation and security aspects. Finally, we include a simple but significative performance analysis of both cases and a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposal."; "Towards a standard SDN-based IPsec management framework";

A signature-based IDS is generally ineffective against zero-day attacks; however, an analysis of the types of attack signatures encountered by such a system over its history, could provide guidance about future attacks. This history is essentially encapsulated into the rules of the IDS itself. An examination of rules can reveal a variety of useful information about the kinds of traffic that a network considers to be malicious. This research performs a statistical and machine learning cluster analysis of Snort rules, with a focus on the network protocols used by the rules. It proceeds in two phases. In Phase 1, algorithms are developed to extract protocol information from Snort rules and to determine their distribution across rule sets. This component of the research shows that there are three major types of protocols used in Snort rules: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). It also provides the frequency (or cardinality) of each such protocol per rule set. Phase 2, which focused on the default enabled rules of the latest Snort rule version, performs cluster analyses using the following three approaches: k-means algorithm, a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm, and a density based clustering algorithm. This component of the research illustrates that with respect to the number of protocols per rule set, TCP use is dominant and that it is reasonable to divide Snort rule sets into three principal clusters. One cluster consists of a single rule set and is characterized by a preponderance of UDP protocol usage among its rules. A second cluster consists of four rule sets and is distinguished by each rule set containing more than 900 TCP-based rules. The last cluster consists of all other rulesets. TCP based rules for rule sets in this cluster are all below 500. Comparison among the three clustering algorithms using the silhouette metric, demonstrate them to be very effective, with negligible variation in performance."; "A Statistical and Cluster Analysis Exploratory Study of Snort Rules";

The huge majority of the existing localization arrangements use additional equipment supplies to accomplish higher limitation precision.

To overcome the problems, we need to study how to grow more precision distance for the strength of the signal model and 3dimensional measurement techniques.

In this event that RSS diminish at the separation, PLE will measure the rate; its esteem depends on the extraordinary proliferation environment. For positioning, the system requires location data.

These solutions are costly in terms of energy, execution time, circuit board area, and — of course — money. Sustainable IoT devices and power-constrained embedded systems cannot afford such costs and are forced to make suboptimal security trade-offs. One such trade-off is the design of architectures which prevent execution of injected shell code, yet have allowed Return Oriented Programming (ROP) to emerge as a more reliable way to execute malicious code following attacks. ROP is a method used to take over the execution of a program by causing the return address of a function to be modified through an exploit vector, then returning to small segments of otherwise innocuous code located in executable memory one after the other to carry out the attacker's aims. It will be shown that the Tiva TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller, which utilizes a Cortex-M4F processor, can be fully controlled with this technique. Sufficient code is pre-loaded into a ROM on Tiva microcontrollers to erase and rewrite the flash memory where the program resides. Then, that same ROM is searched for a Turing-complete gadget set which would allow for arbitrary execution. This allows an attacker to re-purpose the microcontroller, altering the original functionality to their own malicious ends.

RBMs are applied due to their ability to learn high-level features from raw data in an unsupervised way and handle real data representation generated from smart meters and sensors. On top of these extracted features, different classifiers are trained. The performance of the proposed methodology is tested and benchmarked using a dataset from a smart water distribution plant. The results show the efficiency of the proposed methodology in attack detection with high accuracy. In addition, the proposed methodology outperforms the classification model applied without features learning step."; "Intrusion detection in smart cities using Restricted Boltzmann Machines";

Recent security research notes a trend in which developers and vendors have opted out of implementing Bluetooth Low Energy link security in many devices, enabling protocol attacks and attack frameworks. To help defend devices with no link security, researchers recommend the use of Bluetooth Low Energy traffic sniffers to generate auditable communications logs. Unfortunately, current sniffers can only follow a single connection at a time, and some are ineffective at capturing long-lived connections due to synchronization problems. These limitations make current sniffers impractical for use in wireless sensor networks. This paper presents Bluetooth Low Energy Multi (BLE-Multi), a firmware enhancement to the open-source Ubertooth One that enables the sniffing of multiple simultaneous long-lived connections. To increase the capture effectiveness for long-lived connections, a novel synchronization mechanism is proposed that uses transmissions of empty packets to infer information about connection timing. Multi-connection sniffing is achieved by opportunistically switching between connections as they move from the active to inactive state, which is an inherent function in Bluetooth Low Energy to help conserve energy. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that BLE-Multi simultaneously captures multiple active connections while outperforming Ubertooth One when it captures a single connection, paving the way for the development and implementation of automated defensive tools for Bluetooth Low Energy and wireless sensor networks."; "Enabling Bluetooth Low Energy auditing through synchronized tracking of multiple connections";

These benefits are fueled by innovations in orchestration of cloud platforms that make them programmable as Software Defined everything Infrastructures (SDxI). At the same time, sophisticated targeted attacks such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are growing on an unprecedented scale threatening the availability of online businesses. In this paper, we present a novel defense system called Dolus to mitigate the impact of targeted attacks launched against high-value services hosted in SDxI-based cloud platforms. Our Dolus system is able to initiate a ‘pretense’ in a scalable and collaborative manner to deter the attacker based on threat intelligence obtained from attack feature analysis. Using foundations from pretense theory in child play, Dolus takes advantage of elastic capacity provisioning via ‘quarantine virtual machines’ and SDxI policy co-ordination across multiple network domains to deceive the attacker by creating a false sense of success. We evaluate the efficacy of Dolus using a GENI Cloud testbed and demonstrate its real-time capabilities to: (a) detect DDoS and APT attacks and redirect attack traffic to quarantine resources to engage the attacker under pretense, (b) coordinate SDxI policies to possibly block attacks closer to the attack source(s)."; "Intelligent defense using pretense against targeted attacks in cloud platforms";

All the hype surrounding the SDNs is predominantly because of its centralized management functionality, the separation of the control plane from the data forwarding plane, and enabling innovation through network programmability. Despite the promising architecture of SDNs, security was not considered as part of the initial design. Moreover, security concerns are potentially augmented considering the logical centralization of network intelligence. Furthermore, the security and dependability of the SDN has largely been a neglected topic and remains an open issue. The paper presents a broad overview of the security implications of each SDN layer/interface. This paper contributes further by devising a contemporary layered/interface taxonomy of the reported security vulnerabilities, attacks, and challenges of SDN. We also highlight and analyze the possible threats on each layer/interface of SDN to help design secure SDNs. Moreover, the ensuing paper contributes by presenting the state-of-the-art SDNs security solutions. The categorization of solutions is followed by a critical analysis and discussion to devise a comprehensive thematic taxonomy.

However, such heterogeneity faces great challenges in correct, efficient and dynamic network policy implementation because, firstly, existing schemes are limited to exclusively physical or virtual NFBs and not a mix, and secondly, NFBs can co-exist at various locations in the network as a result of emerging technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous netwOrk pOlicy enforCement scheme (HOOC) to overcome these challenges. We first formulate and model HOOC, which is shown be to NP-Hard by reducing from the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). We then propose an efficient online algorithm that can achieve optimal latency-wise NF service chaining amongst heterogenous NFBs. In addition, we also provide a greedy algorithm when operators prefer smaller run-time than optimality. Our simulation results show that HOOC is efficient and scalable whilst testbed implementation demonstrates that HOOC can be easily deployed in the data center environments."; "Enforcing network policy in heterogeneous network function box environment";

In this context, signal processing techniques have been applied to attack detection due to their capability to detect anomalies that are previously unknown, i.e. blind detection. This paper proposes a signal processing framework for the detection and identification of network attacks using concepts of model order selection (MOS), eigenvalues and similarity analysis. In order to validate the proposed framework, we consider network traffic datasets that contain malicious activity such as flood and port probing attacks. We propose to model the network traffic as a superposition of components, namely, user's operations (legitimate traffic), network service operation not related to the user (noise) and the malicious activity. The experiments performed in a real network and also using the DARPA 1998 public dataset show that the proposed blind detection approach achieves satisfactory levels of accuracy in terms of timely detection and identification of TCP/UDP ports under attack."; "Model order selection and eigen similarity based framework for detection and identification of network attacks";

They are accessible by cross-device applications, supporting multiple forms of interaction in cloud environments. In general, mashups manage a huge amount of heterogeneous data from different sources and handle different kinds of users. In this respect, mashup User Interfaces are becoming one of the most important pieces in many kinds of current management systems, such as for certain geographic or environmental information systems working on the Internet. In this type of systems, the user interface plays a particular role due to the huge variety of components or apps that the users need to manage at the same time. However, currently, there has been scant attention paid to the management of the user’s interaction with mashups interfaces. This goal involves the need of having important, well-constructed tools and methods conducting the data acquisition process for managing properly: (a) the interaction over the mashup user interfaces, at the front-end side; (b) the storage of the interaction in relational databases; and (c) well-supported microservices structures handled in the cloud. The fact of having valuable and flexible data acquisition processes encourages the deployment of others important issues of the interaction management, i.e., data searching, data mining, marketing, security, accessibility, usability or traceability of interaction data, among others. In this article, we present a flexible Data Acquisition System capable of capturing the human-computer interactions performed by users over mashup (User) Interfaces with the aim of storing them in a relational database. Firstly, the morphology of traditional mashup applications, their specifications and the relevant information that surrounds an interaction have been studied. Thereupon, a data acquisition system that stores user interaction on mashup based on such specifications was constructed. To achieve that purpose, an architecture of microservices was also designed in the cloud to detect, acquire, and collect the interactions performed over this kind of interfaces. The whole process is ready for acquiring internal data of the information system as well as context information and location awareness. To validate the data acquisition system, some tests on empirical case studies have been developed. Efficiency and effectiveness have also been determined by evaluating the performance of the acquisition system during different load tests. Finally, in order to ensure the software quality, a continuous integration strategy for software development and an easy management of the code have been used, facilitating the software maintenance alongside the microservice architecture, where functionalities are well encapsulated."; "A flexible data acquisition system for storing the interactions on mashup user interfaces";

However, each big data object has a large number of attributes, posing an remarkable challenge on FCM for IoT big data real-time clustering. In this paper, we propose an efficient fuzzy c-means approach based on the tensor canonical polyadic decomposition for clustering big data in Internet of Things. In the presented scheme, the traditional fuzzy c-means algorithm is converted to the high-order tensor fuzzy c-means algorithm (HOFCM) via a bijection function. Furthermore, the tensor canonical polyadic decomposition is utilized to reduce the attributes of every objects for enhancing the clustering efficiency. Finally, the extensive experiments are conducted to compare the developed scheme with the traditional fuzzy c-means algorithm on two large IoT datasets including sWSN and eGSAD regarding clustering accuracy and clustering efficiency. The results argue that the developed scheme achieves a significantly higher clustering efficiency with a slight clustering accuracy drop compared with the traditional algorithm, indicating the potential of the developed scheme for drilling smart data from IoT big data."; "An efficient fuzzy c-means approach based on canonical polyadic decomposition for clustering big data in IoT";
