abstract = "Device security is one of the major challenges for successful implementation of Internet of Things and fog computing environment in current IT space. Researchers and Information Technology (IT) organizations have explored many solutions to protect systems from unauthenticated device attacks (known as outside device attacks). Fog computing uses network devices (e.g. router, switch and hub) for latency-aware processing of collected data using IoT. Then, identification of malicious edge device is one of the critical activities in data security of fog computing environment. Preventing attacks from malicious edge devices in fog computing environment is more difficult because they have certain granted privileges to use and process the data. In this paper, proposed cybersecurity framework uses three technologies which are Markov model, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Virtual Honeypot Device (VHD) to identify malicious edge device in fog computing environment. A two-stage hidden Markov model is used to effectively categorize edge devices in four different levels. VHD is designed to store and maintain log repository of all identified malicious devices which assists the system to defend itself from any unknown attacks in the future. Proposed cybersecurity framework is tested with real attacks in virtual environment created using OpenStack and Microsoft Azure. Results indicated that proposed cybersecurity framework is successful in identifying the malicious device as well as reducing the false IDS alarm rate."

abstract = "Embedded systems (electronic systems with a dedicated purpose that are part of larger devices) are increasing their relevance with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT). Such systems are often resource constrained, battery powered, connected to the internet, and exposed to an increasing number of threats. An approach to detect such threats is through an anomaly-based intrusion detection with machine-learning techniques. However, most of these techniques were not created with energy efficiency in mind. This paper presents an anomaly-based method for network intrusion detection in embedded systems. The proposed method maintains the classifier reliability even when network traffic contents changes. The reliability is achieved through a new rejection mechanism and a combination of classifiers. The proposed approach is energy-efficient and well suited for hardware implementation. The experiments presented in this paper show that the hardware versions of the machine learning algorithms consume 46% of the energy used by their software counterparts, and the feature extraction and packet capture modules consume 58% and 37% of their respective software counterparts."

abstract = "This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing as well as evolving security threats and vulnerabilities and the state-of-the-art countermeasures in Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart grids. The cybersecurity risks in smart grid networks and associated devices prevail in the form of malicious use leading to data espionage, physical damage to devices, intentional denial of service and exploitation for financial gain. We begin with an introduction to IoT and data transfer techniques between different devices, and their role and significance in the growth of smart grids. We then discuss privacy concerns, and various attack motives with which intruders try to break into smart grids. This is followed by a classification of threat actors in modern networks based on the sophistication of attacks they can launch. We also provide a classification of threat vectors in smart grids including attacks against integrity, attacks against availability, attacks against privacy and attacks against authentication. In addition, we investigate the nature and extent of risk posed by advanced persistent threats and the significance of deploying next generation intrusion detection systems in smart grids. The seven-step attack procedure known as cyber kill-chain is discussed and current detection, prevention, and access control measures in practice are also summarized in form of tables. These tables would help the reader correlate prevalent and futuristic attack techniques, countermeasures, and the applicability, scalability and feasibility of current security mechanisms to smart grids for achieving effective cyber hygiene. The paper then introduces novel attack surfaces that inevitably get established due to various cutting-edge communication techniques used in smart grids. One such mechanism discussed in the paper is time sensitive networking that injects the possibility of harnessing time as an attack surface. Based on the current survey, several recommendations for further research are discussed at the end of this paper."
